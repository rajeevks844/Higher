    <b>1. What is what if Analysis?</b> <br>
    What-If Analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those 
     changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. Three kinds of What￾If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios, Goal Seek, and Data Tables. 
     Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine possible results.<br><br>
    <b> 2. List different types of What if Analysis.</b><br>
     Three kinds of What-If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios, Goal Seek, and 
     Data Tables. Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine 
     possible results. A Data Table works with only one or two variables, but it can 
     accept many different values for those variables.<br>
     <b> 3. Do we always need a formulae cell to do what-if analysis? <br> <br>
       
       <b>4. What is the advantage of sorting?</b><br>
       The quick sort is regarded as the best sorting algorithm. This is because of its 
     significant advantage in terms of efficiency because it is able to deal well with a huge 
     list of items. Because it sorts in place, no additional storage is required as well<br><br>
     <b>5. What is the advantage of regression analysis?</b><br>
     The importance of regression analysis is that it is all about data: data means 
     numbers and figures that actually define your business. The advantages of 
     regression analysis is that it can allow you to essentially crunch the numbers to 
     help you make better decisions for your business currently and into the future.<br><br>
     <b>6. What is sorting?</b><br>
     Sorting is any process of arranging items systematically, and has two common, yet 
     distinct meanings: ordering: arranging items in a sequence ordered by some 
     criterion; categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.<br><br>
     <b>7. What is the filter?</b><br>
     Particle filtering is a sampling method that starts with a population of particles, 
     each of which assigns a value to no variables, and has a weight of 1. At each step 
     it can. select a variable that has not been sampled or summed out and is not 
     observed.<br><br>
     <b>8. What is machine learning?</b><br>
     Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model 
     building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can 
     learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human 
     intervention.<br><br>
     <b>9. Define statistics</b><br>
     Statistics is a collection of tools that you can use to get answers to important 
     questions about data. You can use descriptive statistical methods to transform raw 
     observations into information that you can understand and share. ... Statistics is 
     generally considered a prerequisite to the field of applied machine learning.<br><br>
     <b> 10. Where is unsupervised learning used ?</b><br>
     Unsupervised learning is commonly 
     used for finding meaningful patterns and groupings inherent in data, extracting 
     generative features, and exploratory purposes.<br><br>

     <b>1. Explain correlation with the help of an example.</b><br>
     Correlation means association - more precisely it is a measure of the extent to 
     which two variables are related. ... Therefore, when one variable increases as the 
     other variable increases, or one variable decreases while the other decreases. An 
     example of positive correlation would be height and weight.<br>
     <b>2. Explain regression analysis.</b><br>
     Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have 
     impact on a topic of interest. The process of performing a regression allows you to 
     confidently determine which factors matter most, which factors can be ignored, 
     and how these factors influence each other. 
     a regression analysis is done for one of two purposes: In order to predict the value 
     of the dependent variable for individuals for whom some information concerning 
     the explanatory variables is available, or in order to estimate the effect of some 
     explanatory variable on the dependent variable. 
     Example: we can say that age and height can be described using a linear regression 
     model. Since a person's height increases as its age increases, they have a linear 
     relationship.<br><br>
     <b>3. Discuss the role of data filter.</b><br>
      Data filtering is the process of choosing a smaller part of your data set and using 
     that subset for viewing or analysis. Filtering is generally (but not always) temporary 
     – the complete data set is kept, but only part of it is used for the calculation. ... 
     Calculate results for particular groups of interest.
     it is done to make it easier to focus on specific information in a large dataset or 
     table of data. Filtering does not remove or modify data it changes which rows or 
     columns appear in the active Excel worksheet.<br><br>
     <b>4. What is the difference between filter and sorting?</b><br>
     <table  class="table" width="90%" border="0" align="center">

     <b>5. Name 5 programming languages most commonly used for AI. </b><br>
     Top 5 AI programming languages:
     LISP.= LISP, an acronym for list processing, is a programming language that was 
     designed for easy manipulation of data strings. Developed in 1959 by John 
     McCarthy, it is a commonly used language for artificial intelligence (AI) 
     programming.
     Python. = Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming 
     language with dynamic semantics. ... Python's simple, easy to learn syntax 
     emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
     Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity 
     and code reuse.
     C++ = C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by 
     many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset 
     of the C language. A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but 
     optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet.
     Java. = Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software 
     for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled 
     code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including 
     Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
     Prolog.= Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial 
     intelligence and computational linguistics. ... The language has been used for 
     theorem proving, expert systems, term rewriting, type systems, and automated 
     planning, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.<br><br>
     <b>6. Discuss descriptive statistics.</b><br>
      Descriptive statistics summarizes or describes the characteristics of a data set. 
     Descriptive statistics consists of two basic categories of measures: measures of 
     central tendency and measures of variability (or spread). Measures of central 
     tendency describe the center of a data set. 
     For example, it would not be useful to know that all of the participants in our 
     example wore blue shoes. However, it would be useful to know how spread out 
     their anxiety ratings were.
     Descriptive statistics can be useful for two purposes: 1) to provide basic 
     information about variables in a dataset and 2) to highlight potential relationships 
     between variables. The three most common descriptive statistics can be displayed 
     graphically or pictorially and are measures of: Graphical/Pictorial Methods.<br><br>
     <b>7. Discuss inferential statistics.</b><br>
      Inferential statistics is one of the two main branches of statistics. Inferential 
     statistics use a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and 
     make inferences about the population. ... You can use the information from the 
     sample to make generalizations about the diameters of all of the nails. 
     The goal of inferential statistics is to discover some property or general pattern 
     about a large group by studying a smaller group of people in the hopes that the 
     results will generalize to the larger group. 
     Since in most cases you don't know the real population parameter, you can use 
     inferential statistics to estimate these parameters in a way that takes sampling error 
     into account. There are two important types of estimates you can make about the 
     population: point estimates and interval estimates.<br><br>
     <b>8. What are Pivot Tables? How it helps in data interpretation and processing.</b><br>
      A PivotTable is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data. 
     You can use a PivotTable to analyze numerical data in detail, and answer 
     unanticipated questions about your data. A PivotTable is especially designed for: 
     Querying large amounts of data in many user-friendly ways.
     Pivot tables area technique in data processing. They arrange and rearrange (or 
     "pivot") statistics in order to draw attention to useful information. This leads to 
     finding figures and facts quickly making them integral to data analysis. This 
     ultimately leads to helping businesses or individuals make educated decisions.<br><br>
     <b>9. How Machine learning helps in recommending your favourite movie/web series at 
     Online Media or suggesting your products online.</b><br><br>
     <b>10. Discuss supervised learning with the help of an example.</b><br>
      One practical example of supervised learning problems is predicting house prices. 
     ... By leveraging data coming from thousands of houses, their features and prices, 
     we can now train a supervised machine learning model to predict a new house's 
     price based on the examples observed by the model.
     Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory 
     of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled 
     datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
     Some popular examples of supervised machine learning algorithms are: Linear 
     regression for regression problems. Random forest for classification and 
     regression problems. Support vector machines for classification problems.<br><br>
  
     <b>1. What is the role of charts in data analysis? Explain with examples.</b><br>
     Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the 
     relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly 
     than the raw data. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by 
     hand (often on graph paper) or by computer using a charting application.
     • It makes the data more presentable and easy to understand. By looking at the 
     chart itself one can draw certain inferences or analysis.
     • It helps in summarizing a very large data in a very crisp and easy manner.
     • It helps in better comparison of data.<br><br>
    <b> 2. Name and discuss types of Machine Learning.</b><br>
      These are three types of machine learning:
     • supervised learning:- Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial 
     intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm is trained on input data that has 
     been labeled for a particular output. ... In supervised learning, the aim is to make 
     sense of data within the context of a specific question. Some popular examples 
     of supervised machine learning algorithms are:
     1 Linear regression for regression problems.
     2 Random forest for classification and regression problems.
     3 Support vector machines for classification problems.
     • unsupervised learning:- Unsupervised learning refers to the use of artificial 
     intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in data sets containing data 
     points that are neither classified nor labeled. ... In other words, unsupervised 
     learning allows the system to identify patterns within data sets on its own. In 
     contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning methods are suitable 
     when the output variables (i.e the labels) are not provided. ... Some examples of 
     unsupervised learning algorithms include K-Means Clustering, Principal 
     Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering.
     • reinforcement learning:- Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine 
     learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an 
     environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. 
     Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, 
     alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
     Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be 
     applied include trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, 
     controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways. For 
     example, parking can be achieved by learning automatic parking policies. Two 
     types of reinforcement learning are 1) Positive 2) Negative. Two widely used 
     learning model are 1) Markov Decision Process 2) Q learning. Reinforcement 
     Learning method works on interacting with the environment, whereas the 
     supervised learning method works on given sample data or example<br><br>

     Machine Learning.</b><br>
     One of the most common applications of Machine Learning is Automatic Friend 
     Tagging Suggestions in Facebook or any other social media platform. Facebook 
     uses face detection and Image recognition to automatically find the face of the 
     person which matches it's Database and hence suggests us to tag that person

     <b>6. What is reinforcement machine learning? Explain with the help of an example. List </b><br>
      2 area of applications.
     Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be 
     applied include trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, 
     controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways. For 
     example, parking can be achieved by learning automatic parking policies.<br><br>
     <b>7. What are soring and filters? How sorting and filter are useful for AI?</b><br>
      • Sorting :-AI's use in sorting started with systems in the 1970s to 1980s. These 
     systems were based on optical sensors and electronics that compared gray 
     values or colors. Based on the ratio between these colors, the electronic circuit 
     would make a rules-based decision whether to keep or eject the material.
     Sorting is important in programming for the same reason it is important in 
     everyday life. It is easier and faster to locate items in a sorted list than unsorted. 
     Sorting algorithms can be used in a program to sort an array for later searching 
     or writing out to an ordered file or report.
     • Filter :- Filtering is a useful way to see only the data that you want displayed. 
     You can use filters to display specific records in a form, report, query, or 
     datasheet, or to print only certain records from a report, table, or query. Artificial 
     Intelligence Examples
